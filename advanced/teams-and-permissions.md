## Working in teams

> GitHub private repositories for personal and team accounts are [free of charge](https://github.com/pricing). 

If your documentation is maintained by a team, you can either:

- Use a personal account and invite individual collaborators
  
  This allows you to work on public and private repositories. However, only the *owner* of the GitHub repository will be able to publish
  or unpublish documentation on the Documentation Portal.

- Use teams in a GitHub organisation account

  Your documentation repository would need to belong to a GitHub team/organisation. From there, you can create a team, invite team members and give the team
  read/write permissions to your repository. You can similarly grant individuals access to your repository.

  Any individual or team with `admin` level access to the repository would be able to publish/unpublish that documentation from the documentation portal.

  An example of an organisation repository's access configuration is shown below. In this example, only `Team mate 1` and `Repository Owner` have the rights to publish/unpublish the documentation from the Documentation Portal.

  > For your convenience, you can use the [Documentation Portal's GitHub organisation](https://github.com/Documentation-Portal) to host your documentation repositories.

# Get started

You will need a [TechPass](https://www.techpass.gov.sg) account to host your documentation, as well as a free [Gitlab.com](https://gitlab.com) to host your documentation's git repository. You will also need to use [Docsify](https://docsify.js.org) to structure and view your documentation locally before you push it up your repository. 

## Hosting your documentation

### 1. Sign in with TechPass

### 2. Link your account to your Gitlab.com account

Once signed in, go to the account tab and click on the "authorize to Gitlab" link. You will be directed to your Gitlab account and you will have to grant OAuth permissions for the documentation portal to pull your documentation repository and host it.

Once your Gitlab project is linked to the documentation portal, it will automatically pull your repository's markdown files upon every push to your master branch and host them. Changes will be almost instantaneous.

### Create your Docsify project

The easiest way to get started with Docsify is through its [command line tool](https://docsify.js.org/#/quickstart). You will need to have Node.js and NPM installed on your machine.

# What is this documentation portal for?

With this portal, developers like you can write project documentation with markdown files, in your own git repositories. They are then automatically synced and published to the documentation portal.

## Why do I have to write technical documentation?

Technical documentation helps other users to understand your software. Hence, your software that is meant to be reused needs proper documentation.

## Public and private documentation

Users have the choice to decide whether they want to publish their own documentation on the public-facing or private site (which requires a Techpass login to access).

### Start writing your own documentation

The Documentation Portal supports two documentation formats:

- Markdown, rendered in [Docsify](https://docsify.js.org)

# Documentation portal user guide

## What is the documentation portal?

Developers can now write their project documentation with markdown files in their own git repositories, which are automatically synced to the documentation portal.

### Public and private documentation

Users can choose whether their documentation sites are public-facing or behind a TechPass login.

## Start writing documentation

You will need a [TechPass](https://portal.techpass.gov.sg) and free [Gitlab](https://www.gitlab.com) account. The documentation portal makes use of [Docsify](https://docsify.js.org) to render your markdown documentation. [Get started here](get-started)

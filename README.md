# What is this documentation portal for?

With this portal, developers like you can write project documentation with markdown files, in your own git repositories. They are then automatically synced and published to the documentation portal.

## Why do I have to write technical documentation?

Technical documentation is crucial for your users to understand and use your software and its APIs. In addition, [the user satisfaction of a system is strongly influenced by its documentation](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/037872069090063N).

## Public and private documentation

Users have the choice to decide whether they want to publish their own documentation on the public-facing or private site (which requires a Techpass login to access).

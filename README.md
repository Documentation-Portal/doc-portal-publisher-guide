# Documentation portal publisher guide

## What is the documentation portal?

Developers can now write their project documentation with markdown files in their own git repositories, which are **automatically synced and published** to the documentation portal.

## Why write technical documentation?

Every piece of software that is meant to be reused needs proper user-facing documentation. [Read more about writing documentation](advanced/writing-documentation).

### Public and private documentation

Users can choose whether their documentation sites are public-facing or behind a TechPass login.

### Start writing documentation

The Documentation Portal supports two documentation formats:

- Markdown, rendered through [Docsify](https://docsify.js.org)
- OpenAPI (also known as Swagger) definitions in JSON or YAML, rendered through [ReDoc](https://github.com/redocly/redoc)

You will need a [TechPass](https://portal.techpass.gov.sg) and free [github.com](https://www.github.com) account. [Get started here](get-started).
